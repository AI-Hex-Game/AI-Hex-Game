# AI-Hex-Game

This is an implementation of Hex in Java. It was originally used as a school project

## Game of Hex ##
Hex is a challenging strategy board game for two players played on a board of hexagonal tiles. It can be seen as having a similar complexity as chess or go, but with simple rules and a clear winning state that allows new players to quickly pick up and play with ease. The game offers intricacies that make the game rewarding to master and, combined with the impossibility of a draw-game, gives a satisfying game.

## What is the point of this implementation? ##
We will define and implement a turn by turn basic Hex, and we will design a variety of Artificial intelligence (AI) players that can not only play to the game rules, but also take advantage of the nuances that they offer.
for more informations, please check the report in docs section.

## Pulling ##
create a new directory where ever you want in your PC, open git bash and type the following lines:
git init
git pull https://github.com/AI-Hex-Game/AI-Hex-Game.git
now you can test the game (using Eclipse or u can create an executable jar file), Enjoy playing!!
